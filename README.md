## General Information
Build a model to predict factors leading to churn in Telecom industry
-Predict Whether high value customers will churn or not
-Identify strong predictors of churn  
- Dataset         : train.csv
- Data Dictionay  : Data_Description.pdf


## Objective
Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Approach
Steps followed in the data analysis
- Load the data
- Plan is to build multiple models 
- Model 1 :
-   Build a model for the given train data without handling data augumentation/Dropout
-   Assess the model accuracy and loss function
-   Record findings
- Model 2:
-   Build a model for given train data after handling data agumentation
-   Assess the model accurcay and loss function
-   Check if class imbalance is present
- Model 3:
-   Build a model after handling data augumentation, class imbalance
-   Assess the model accuracy and loss function 
-   Record your observation
